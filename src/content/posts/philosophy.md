## Masculinity  

I desire **hardness** — more specifically *Roman hardness*: a hardness of character.  

***This hardness is not only of the body, but also of the mind.***  

Over the years, I have struggled with depression, mental challenges, and extreme loneliness.  
Issues of self-esteem and self-worth follow me closely.  

I often feel deeply **non-conformist**. Because I cannot simply adopt a ready-made belief system, I am forced to search for one of my own. Most people, I think, inherit their beliefs; I want to create mine.  

> "Your belief system shapes who you are."  

Dear reader, because I resist conformity, I have been easy prey to nihilism. This leaves me with a weak sense of identity and a struggle to fit-in with other's  

when you want to be something, acting,faking, trying to fit in, copying and developing
helps alot, 

> I you wish to be "X" you need to act and behave like "X" thing
- example -
A ***ideal programmer,*** has routine of daily coding daily reading and sitting most of the time on his computer and doing tweaking stuff. has a sophisticated habit related to tech, his speeches are technical and idea's often revolve around it talks like a tech guy and behaves like knowledgeable professional with a sophisticated yet simple way of talking with other's etc etc.............

masculinity is about strong body and mind that can endure almost anything and collection of affirmative qualities and dominating spirit not evil but noble in nature not greed but growth in nature.

# hero's journey
I desire strength of steel, mind that can conquer the nature
i will promise to enjoy my life with affirmative qualities, this will be my greatest pleasure to stand up to my ideals 
who i want to be,
<pr>i am already,
                      its is process, of becoming oneself
                     rest is amor fati
                    </pr>
                    
 ## need for power
  in short nature is quite cruel,with power you are allowed to have a small comfort zone 
  	without power and strength, you won't survive 
  	if you want to survive and also live with dignity, 
  	seek power struggle and endure
